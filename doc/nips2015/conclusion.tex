\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We demonstrate a practical system to navigate the cost-delay-accuracy tradeoff surface by \textit{asynchronous active classification}.
 This system highlights the potential value of making the crowd available to machine-learning classifiers at test time, and we hope inspires further research in this promising direction.

Much of the research effort associated with demonstrating this system was ``plumbing,'' writing and debugging large pieces of logistical code for marshaling and managing the humans and machine learning algorithms in an asynchronous fashion.
 We have published an easily extensible and customizable base for further work in asynchronous active classification, which we call L.E.N.S.E. (Learning from Expensive, Noisy, Slow Experts) at \url{github.com/lense-project/lense-base}, that we hope proves useful.
