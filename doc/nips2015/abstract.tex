We explore making time-sensitive predictions on an infinite stream of
``problem instances'' by selectively querying humans for noisy partial
information, and exploiting previous observations to train a classifier
that can incrementally take over from the humans. This stream is assumed
to be too large to be kept in memory, so querying backwards over
previously seen examples is considered impractical.
