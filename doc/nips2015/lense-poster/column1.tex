\begin{block}{What is on-the-job learning?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item 
  \textbf{On-the-job learning} allows a system to query the crowd for labels on the uncertain parts of an input as it arrives \textbf{before} making a prediction.

    \item Can \textbf{maintain accuracy on difficult examples} by asking the crowd for assistance.
    \item \textbf{Reduces costs} on simpler examples by learning a better prediction model online (on-the-job).
    \item User specifies a base prediction model and how to trade off accuracy, cost and latency. 
    \item System optimizes for utility using ideas from game playing and Bayesian decision theory.

    \textbf{Online active learning}
      chooses the most informative examples to label \emph{after} classification. 
      Impossible to maintain high accuracy initially.

    \textbf{Active classification} 
    learns a static policy from a labelled dataset to choose features to query at test time.
    &  & \begin{center}{\Huge\checkmark}\end{center} \\
    \textbf{On-the-job learning}
    combines advantages of both the above methods. Note,
Legion:AR \citep{lasecki2013real} studied the user interface
      aspects of on-the-job learning, while we study the machine learning
      aspects of it.
