  \begin{itemize}
    \item In {\bf on the job learning} when a new input arrives, the system can choose to query the crowd on \emph{parts} of the input it is uncertain about {\bf before} making a prediction.

    \item The framework allows systems to maintain accuracy on difficult examples by asking the crowd for assistance, \emph{while} reducing costs by learning a better prediction model on-the-job.
    \item {\bf The key challenge} is how to trade off latency, cost and
      accuracy, which is modeled using {\em a game tree and Bayesian decision theory}.
