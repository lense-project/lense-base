% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\maketitle

\pl{I'd prefer a shorter title;
  not sure 'Fake it until you make it' is the right metaphor anyway
  since 'faking it' here actually means doing a good job too;
  if you want something fun, something along 'training wheels' or 'cyborg'?
  Something about smoothly transitioning from humans to machines in an online manner?
  Actually, why not call it LENSE?
}

\pl{not sure we actually want to pivot around the word 'active classification' so much;
I think we're sufficiently different from it; not only are they typically
not querying humans, but there's not a sense that the learning algorithm
gets better and the knowledge gets transfered from humans to computers,
which is \emph{the key point}}
