\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

A limited version of this setting has been independently proposed
several times under different names over the past two decades. It's been
called ``Active Learning in a streaming setting'', ``Online Active
Learning'' or ``Label Efficient Learning,'' to name a few. This is
generally proposed under two limitations: the ``problem instances'' must
be multi-class classification problems, and the learning algorithm
optimizes a Frequentist objective that does not provide a way for you to
specify the complicated trade-off between expense, time delay, and
expected number of errors.

This project proposes two improvements on the historical work:

\begin{itemize}
  \item We propose a way to do structured instance prediction in the general case, by which we mean we can handle arbitrary multi-variable problem instances, with factor-graph structure. We also allow collection of human opinions about one variable at a time. (We stress arbitrary factor graphs, because there have been domain specific online structured prediction systems in the past, e.g. dependency parsing by Dan Roth)
  \item We also provide a novel fully Bayesian approach to Online Active Learning, which can optimize arbitrary loss functions.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Related Work}

\paragraph{Flock} \cite{cheng2015flock}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Ask crowd for features and classifications.
  \item People are apparently bad at providing reasons.
  \item Have people propose reasons for difference between positive, negative classes, and then cluster those reasons.
  \item At the end of the day, use machine learning to evaluate those features.
  \item [9,24] might be relevant.
  \item Fantastic for "latent features"?
  \item First ask people to generate features that distinguish 2 images (i.e. using contrast). 
  \item Then cluster responses with k-means and have people pose question given the text blah.
  \item Then gets labels via turk task.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Legion:AR} \cite{lasecki2013realtime}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Online activity recognition
  \item Real-time using quickTurkit / Legion system
  \item Hide some visual details (for privacy concerns)
  \item Show crowd better than single person.
  \item Using model results in faster labelling.
  \item Extensive study of user interface.
  \item Very simple HMM model.
\end{itemize}
