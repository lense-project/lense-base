Ok, taking a pass on the paper right now...

Let's hope there aren't any git conflicts.

In short, we need a 100 word summary of our project for the faire.

Also, we will have a 30m grading session on Sunday, Monday, or Wed.

The Software Fair will run from Noon-3:15pm on Tuesday June 9th in Wallenberg Hall.

Just a thought: we go with Duncan, Keenon, Amy, Jamieson, and Joe to London, England on Friday Aug 14. 

We leave the adults in London and take Duncan up north an hour or so to his GK camp, leave him there until Monday early afternoon (which I think is when it ends).

Spend the rest of Saturday, Sunday, and Monday morning with our older kids and their significant others.

Then go pick Duncan up and then either do something together or take everyone to airport.

Send them home, and we go on to Barcelona for Tues-Sat.

Please try to have this by today - at least a complete, well thought-out outline of what sections / figures you want to have with TODOs.

I'd like to take stock of what needs to be done, and perhaps help write some introductions / give high-level structural comments.

Can you give percyliang@gmail.com write access to the repo?
