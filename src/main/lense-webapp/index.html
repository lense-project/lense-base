            Example descriptions from Bernstein:
            <ol>
                <li>You will be shown a 5-10 second video with a slider below it.</li>
                <li>Move the slider to identify <b>the best photo in the video</b>.</li>
                <li>Click "Good Photo" to choose the photo. Once you have one that you are happy with, click "Submit".</li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
                <li>Work simultaneously with other Turkers by moving your slider to agree on <b>the best photo in the video</b>.</li>
                <li>If your slider is near other Turkers's sliders, we will narrow down  the video to that clip and keep going. You get a point if your slider was inside the clip when this happens. Continue narrowing down the video until you have agreed on one photo.</li>
                <li>We will pay anyone who has at least one point. If you had no points, we will ask you a backup question to verify payment.</li>
            </ol>
            -->
            <ol>
                <li>You'll complete a quick one minute tutorial.</li>
                <li>Simple multiple choice questions will appear in real time.</li>
                <li>Click on the <button style="padding: 10px">button</button> that <b>best answers the question</b> (there are also keyboard shortcuts which look like <span class="key">k</span>).</li>
                <li>Earn a bonus of <span class="bonus">$0.01</span> for each question you answer.</li>
            </ol>
            (If you don't answer a question within <b>10 seconds</b> it will time out and be replaced by another one. No pressure though. There are lots of questions to answer.)
